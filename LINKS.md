**NOTE**: The homework will be posted in GitLab for the current week and the following 2 weeks, so you can understand the underlying problem and see what is expected for the output. As the class progresses each week, you'll see concepts for each week relating to the homework assigned that week. I recommend planning before we cover the topic, asking questions during the week we cover the topic, and reviewing the topic prior to submitting your final homework solution -- this will help reinforce the concepts and help you plan for such projects at work.

Feel free to do some searching on how certain aspects of the homework may be solved with Google, StackOverflow.com, etc. Note questions you might want to ask as we cover a topic, or feel free to come in during office hours to clarify details. Homework is due usually the next Thursday or two weeks later -- refer to Bootcamp Spot for deadlines.
